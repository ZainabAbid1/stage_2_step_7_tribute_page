  <b> Brief History of Malcolm X </b>
  <p> Malcolm X was an African-American  human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement. He was a vocal advocate for black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the black community. A naturally gifted orator, Malcolm X exhorted Black people to cast off the shackles of racism "by any means necessary," including violence. The fiery civil rights leader broke with the Nation of Islam shortly before his assassination in 1965 at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, where he had been preparing to deliver a speech.
